********************* How do I resize the game window? *********************
============================================================================
You can make the game bigger and easier to see by editing the scale setting
in settings.cfg. In future there will be a button inside of the game that
will launch this file for editing the game settings.

******************* Why doesn't it work on my computer? ********************
============================================================================
I don't know. If it won't run on your system for whatever reason, you could
clone the repo and compile from source.
